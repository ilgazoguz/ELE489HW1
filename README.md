# ELE489 HW-1

  I used Visual Studio Code 1.98.2 x64 for the analysis.ipynb file. It explains every step of the code with markdowns, visualizes the data with graphs and explains my reasoning behind every preprocessing step I took. The result is the confusion matrix and classification reports of kNN for both Euclidean and Manhattan distance metrics and for k=11 (why 11 was chosen is explained and can easily be changed).
-It is important to note that if you are using VSCode, restricted mode must be disabled to be able to run the code and see the markdowns.

kNN.py can be run in Spyder5 through Anaconda. Unlike analysis.ipynb it goes straight to the point and yields the confusion matrix and classification reports of kNN for both Euclidean and Manhattan distance metrics and for k=11. The 5th variable of kNN function corresponds to the k value, and can be changed to see the results for other k values. 

Both codes should work as long as they are in the same directory as wine.data .
